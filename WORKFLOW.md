# WORKFLOW — Choose Your Own Adventure (Solo Simulation)

I worked solo, but simulated a 3–4 person GitHub Flow by creating branches with my username, opening pull requests, leaving review comments, and merging them like a team would.  
This log documents each stage with screenshots.

---

## Stage 1 — Setup
- Created GitHub repository `cyoa-markdown-story`.
- Cloned locally and added `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `intro.md`, and a `pages/` folder with story stubs.
- Made initial commit and pushed to `main`.

## Stage 2 — Expand
- Created branch `will-choice-a` and added Choice A content. Opened PR and left a review comment.  
- Created branch `will-choice-b` and added Choice B content. Opened PR and left a review comment.

## Stage 3 — Review
- Reviewed each PR, left comments, merged into `main`, and deleted the branches.

## Stage 4 — Edit
- Created new branch `will-edit-a` for a small change on A2-observe.  
- Opened PR, left a quick comment, merged, and deleted the branch.

## Stage 5 — Finalize
- Pulled latest `main`.  
- Verified merged branches with `git branch --merged`.  
- Repo is now finalized with all branches merged.

## Notes
- I worked solo but followed GitHub Flow exactly as if I had teammates.  
- PR comments are included to simulate review feedback.  
- All branches (`will-choice-a`, `will-choice-b`, `will-edit-a`) were merged back into `main` and deleted afterwards.
