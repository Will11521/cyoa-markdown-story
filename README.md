# Choose Your Own Adventure — *The Signal at Dawn*

This is a Markdown-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" story created for my Web Development IV assignment.  
The project was designed to practice GitHub Flow (branches, pull requests, reviews, merges) while also building out a branching narrative.

## 🌌 The Story
**The Signal at Dawn** begins in a dim cabin, with a faint ping rising from the void.  
From there, the reader chooses their path — follow the signal, stay put, or dig deeper into side branches.  
Each choice leads to new pages in the `pages/` folder, some ending in dead-ends, others opening new storylines.

All story content is written in Markdown files. Links between choices connect the files together, so clicking one option continues the journey.

## 🛠️ How I Worked (GitHub Flow)
Since this was meant to be a team project but I worked solo, I simulated teammates by creating multiple branches with my username.  
Each branch added or edited story content, and I opened pull requests, left review comments, and merged them back into `main`.  

The process went through 5 stages:
1. **Setup** → Repo created, base files committed.  
2. **Expand** → Branches (`will-choice-a`, `will-choice-b`) added new story paths.  
3. **Review** → Pull requests opened, reviewed, merged, and branches deleted.  
4. **Edit** → Extra branch (`will-edit-a`) for small tweaks, PR merged.  
5. **Finalize** → All branches merged, verified with `git branch --merged`.  

Screenshots of each stage are in the `WORKFLOW.md` file.
